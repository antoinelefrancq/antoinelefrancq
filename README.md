    <h1>Hello :wave: </h1>
    <p>:bust_in_silhouette: My name is Antoine.</p>
    <p> I'm from Belgium 🍟 but I live in France 🍷 and for a short time in Guadeloupe 🥥 (but I'll come back in France soon 🥖).</p>
    <p>I'm working in JavaScript and NodeJs. I followed a specialization in React (and Redux) and I plan to improve my knowledges in back-end (with a specilzation called "Data &  API" proposed by my school).</p>
    <p>🌱 After that, I'd like to learn Typescript and get betters skills in Security.</p>
    <p>⚡ At the same time, I'm looking for a job in development (web, mobile, gaming...).</p>
   <p>💬 I'm open to learn any langage needed in a futur job, tell me what do you truly desire. </p>
