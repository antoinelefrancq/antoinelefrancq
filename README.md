### Hello :wave:

:bust_in_silhouette: My name is Antoine
I'm from Belgium 🍟 but I live in France 🍷 and for a short time in Guadeloupe 🥥 (but I'll come back in France soon 🥖)
I"m working in JavaScript and NodeJs. I followed a specialization in React (and Redux) and I plan to improve my knowledges in back-end (with a specilzation called "Data &  API" proposed by my school). 
🌱 After that, I'd like to learn Typescript and get betters skills in Security.
⚡ At the same time, I'm looking for a job in development (web, mobile, gaming,...)
💬 I'm open to learn any langage needed in a futur job, tell me what do you truly desire.
